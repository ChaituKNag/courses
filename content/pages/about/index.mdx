Hi!

Naga Chaitanya Konada is a frontend developer best known for developing highly performing web applications using most modern technical solutions which proved to stand the test of time by being accessible, secure, scalable and modular.

My best work is in React, Node.js and ES6. I love exploring different aspects of frontend development and most recently I have gotten a kick for JAMStack architectures and JavaScript based backends including some serverless stuff.

Are you looking for details of my professional experience, my education, technologies I worked on etc? How about having a look at my resume that you can download from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TWnPqf1X40KPTY5kF55cGBEHfkJpqGun/view?usp=sharing) as a PDF file.
